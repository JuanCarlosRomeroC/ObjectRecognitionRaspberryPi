# ObjectRecognitionRaspberryPi
This project is about displaying a simple Real-Time Object Detection system which includes using Google’s TensorFlow Lite software that is installed in a Raspberry Pi 4, running Raspbian OS. It uses Google’s pre-trained COCO SSD MobileNet v1 model. The goal is to implement this project in Penang Science Cluster's TechLab and implement the necessary functions needed to ensure the project is automated, without the need of any human input.
